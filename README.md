# Synthetic Data Generator 

A toolkit for generating synthetic data for customer feedback and system resource usage. This repository provides functions to simulate customer feedback (positive and negative) and system usage (CPU, disk, and nodes), useful for testing, analysis, and data modeling.

- Simulate **customer feedback** data with predefined positive and negative feedback samples.
- Simulate **system resource usage** data, including CPU usage, disk usage, and the number of nodes, based on hourly ranges.
